# IndyHackers.org

![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/mileszs/indyhackers.org.svg?branch=master)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mileszs/indyhackers.org/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mileszs/indyhackers.org)

## To Do

### General
- Use indyhackersapi.herokuapp.com for calendar on the front page.
  - Show "This Week" and "Last Week" sections
- Update to Rails 4
- Is it time for a new design?
- Should the main, content-y stuff be static, on PaperPlane, leaving the job board as the only thing requiring "a backend" (which we could locate at jobs.indyhackers.org)?
- Offer meeting organizers a list of open weekday evenings, pulled dynamically from current calendar data.

### Job Board
- Read-only API
- Allow hackers to apply on the site, rather than finding info in the post
  - GitHub link
  - LinkedIn link
  - Upload resume
- Make it work well on mobile devices; integrate Skeleton
    - http://jamus.co.uk/demos/rwd-demonstrations/
    - http://getskeleton.com/
- Consider using a completely different design from the main site for the job board
- Make preview a tab of editing a job post, like on GitHub, instead of below the post.
