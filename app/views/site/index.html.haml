        Saint Valentine's Day has arrived. You know what that means: IndyPy at 7PM! Before we get that far, Monday features Indy Scala's regular monthly meeting. Then, on Wednesday, the Indy Javascript Society meets at ExactTarget downtown. In case you haven't had your fill, Thursday the Indy Software Artisans get together. I can only assume Indy.js and IndySA plan to review each member's Valentine's Day experience, assess what went wrong and what went right, and begin planning for next year. (Note: There is a non-zero chance that they won't talk about Valentine's Day at all.)
