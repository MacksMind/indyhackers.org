      If you're like me, you want to attend several different conferences every year, but you have a hard time justifying the expense. RailsConf alone is around $800, and that doesn't count hotel and travel! Thankfully, this year, you can attend a great conference in Indianapolis: [re:build](http://rebuildconf.com/). Rebuild brings the opportunity to see speakers such as Yehuda Katz (Rails core, jQuery, SproutCore developer) and Faruk Ate≈ü (Modernizer, former UI Engineer at Apple) without paying for hotel and travel. The cost? A mere $149. [Go get your ticket now](http://rebuild.ticketleap.com/2011/).
